Due to the challenge of selecting the right running shoes, I decided to scrap the Running Shoe Guru website (https://www.runningshoesguru.com/) to gather important specs/features about the shoes, including:

1. Brand
2. Model
3. Previous model
4. Type
5. Weight
6. MSRP (Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price)
7. Heel
8. Toe
9. Heel drop
10. Carbon plate
11. Sizing
12. Heel fit
13. Midfoot fit
14. Toebox fit
15. Type of cushioning
16. Amount of cushioning
17. Stability
18. Flexibility
19. Family

For trail shoes:
20. Rockplate
21. Traction
22. Water resistance
23. Road-to-trail


Finally, upon applying the filter analysis, I realized that the wide "Midfoot fit" is the most essential feature determining whether I can wear that shoe properly. The hypothesis behind this is due to my flat feet, which increase the volume of the midfoot. The over-pronation induces the medial arch strike; hence, the feet adapt to have more volume support. The finding suggests that, although I used common wide shoes such as Adidas Adizero Boston 12 and Nike Invincible Run 3, I also feel not comfortable with them. Moreover, those shoes with my inappropriate running leading to the injury. "The right shoe is the shoe that you feel most comfortable in."
